# Unstructured data to structured
 Converts unstructured data from a specified data resource to structured data using provided queries.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `dlt` library (you can install it using `pip install dlt`)
- destination dependencies, in our case `bigquery` (`pip install bigquery`)

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install the required library by running the following command:

```shell
pip install dlt[bigquery]
```

## Init the pipeline
```sh
dlt init unstructured_data bigquery
```

## Install requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set credentials
1. Open `.dlt/secrets.toml`.
2. Enter the OpenAI secrets:

    ```toml
    [sources.unstructured_data]
    openai_api_key = "openai_api_key"
    ```
3. Enter your email account secrets in the same section `[sources.unstructured_data]`:

    ```toml
    host = 'imap.example.com'
    email_account = "example@example.com"
    password = 'set me up!'
    ```

Use [App password](#getting-gmail-app-password) to set the password for a Gmail account.

## Set destination credentials
1. Open `.dlt/secrets.toml`.
2. Enter the BigQuery secrets:
   ```toml
   [destination.bigquery]
   location = "US"
   [destination.bigquery.credentials]
   project_id = "set me up!"
   private_key = "set me up!"
   client_email = "set me up!"
   ```

## Configure unstructured source
### Define queries
You must provide a dictionary of queries to be applied to the unstructured
data during processing. Each query maps a field name to a query string
that specifies how to process the field.

Queries example:
```python
queries = {
    "recipient_company_name": "Who is the recipient of the invoice? Just return the name. If you don't know, then return None",
    "invoice_amount": "What is the total amount of the invoice? Just return the amount as decimal number, no currency or text. If you don't know, then return None",
    "invoice_date": "What is the date of the invoice? Just return the date. If you don't know, then return None",
    "invoice_number": "What is the invoice number? Just return the number. If you don't know, then return None",
    "service_description": "What is the description of the service that this invoice is for? Just return the description. If you don't know, then return None",
    "phone_number": "What is the company phone number? Just return the phone number. If you don't know, then return None",
}
```

Customize the INVOICE_QUERIES dict in the `unstructured_data/settings.py` file if you want to extract
other information, or if your invoices have different structure.

## Configure inbox source
### Usage

1. Ensure that the email account you want to access allows access by less secure apps (or use an
   [app password](#getting-gmail-app-password)).
1. Replace the placeholders in `.dlt/secrets.toml` with your IMAP server hostname, email account
   credentials.
1. Customize the FILTER_EMAILS list in the `inbox/settings.py` file if you want to fetch emails only
   from specific senders.
1. Customize the GMAIL_GROUP in the `inbox/settings.py` file if you want to fetch emails
   for specific Google Group.
1. Set the STORAGE_FOLDER_PATH in the `inbox/settings.py` file to the folder where you want to save
   attachments (if required).
1. Set the DEFAULT_START_DATE in the `inbox/settings.py` file to the date you want to fetch emails from.

### Accessing Gmail Inbox

To connect to the Gmail server, we need the below information.

- SMTP server DNS. Its value will be 'imap.gmail.com' in our case.
- SMTP server port. The value will be 993. This port is used for Internet message access protocol
  over TLS/SSL.

### Set up Gmail with a third-party email client

An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives a less secure app or device permission to access
your Google Account. App passwords can only be used with accounts that have 2-Step Verification
turned on.

Step 1: Create and use App Passwords
1. Go to your Google Account.
1. Select Security.
1. Under "How you sign in to Google", select **2-Step Verification** -> Turn it on.
1. Select again **2-Step Verification**.
1. At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
1. Enter a name of device that helps you remember where youâ€™ll use the app password.
1. Select Generate.
1. To enter the app password, follow the instructions on your screen. The app password is the
   16-character code that generates on your device.
1. Select Done.

Step 2: Turn on IMAP in Gmail
1. In Gmail, in the top right, click Settings -> See all settings.
1. At the top, click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.
1. In the IMAP Access section, select Enable IMAP.
1. At the bottom, click Save Changes.

## Run the pipeline

```python
python unstructured_data_pipeline.py
```

The `unstructured_to_structured_source` function includes a transformer-type
resource that processes each item using the `unstructured` library.
The processing results are retrieved as a dictionary, which has a structure similar to the following:
```python
{
    'file_name': '/test_data/invoice_1.pdf',
    'recipient_company_name': 'XYZ Corporation',
    'invoice_amount': '11235.00',
    'invoice_date': 'June 30, 2023',
    'invoice_number': 'INV-549283',
    'service_description': 'Premium widget delivery and installation services',
    'phone_number': 'None'
    'metadata': {...},
}
```
Then `dlt` saves all processed structured data to the database (e.g. bigquery).


## Deploy

Run the command:

```shell
dlt deploy --schedule "0 18 * * *" unstructured_data_pipeline.py github-action 
```
